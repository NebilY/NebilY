# Hey there! 👋

I'm Nebil Y, a Computer Information Technology enthusiast and an explorer of all things tech. Welcome to my little corner on GitHub!

## About Me

📚 I'm currently a student at Minnesota State University, Mankato, working towards my B.S. in Computer Information Technology with a side dish of Marketing. Graduation day is expected in May 2025.

🚀 When I'm not buried in textbooks and code, I'm out there exploring the world of technology. I love diving into new projects, experimenting with different languages, and building stuff that hopefully makes the world a bit more interesting.

## My Toolbox 🛠️

I'm a multi-tool kind of person when it comes to coding:

- **Languages**: Java, C#, Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, SQL
- **Frameworks**: Spring Boot, React, Next.js, Node.js, Express.js
- **Dev Tools**: Git, AWS, MongoDB, Jupyter, Postman, Jenkins

## Adventures So Far 🌟
